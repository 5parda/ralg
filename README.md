# Random Art Line Generator

A random project, I got bored and just wanted to make something completely random. I know this program doesn't work necessarily well, it was more for entertainment :)




## Installation:

You'll need to install Python and Pillow. Please install Python from: https://www.python.org/

To install Pillow, please open a terminal and run this command:

```bash
 pip install pillow

```
## How to run:

To run the Random Art Line Generator, please place it in whatever directory you wish (and name the file what you'd like to name it). Then, CD into the directory of where the file is and run it with python. Here is an example:

```bash
 cd Desktop/Art
 python Art.py
```
